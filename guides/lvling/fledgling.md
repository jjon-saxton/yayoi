Leveling Your Fledgling Adventurer (level 81-120)
================================================

If you have followed my [guides](/~yayoi/guides/lvling/newblets) so far then you'll be level 81 in no time, especially if you were power leveled. Things will start to go really fast or depressingly slow depending on the guild you are in, the money you have amassed, or the friends you have. This is kinda just how it is in Fiesta, unfortunately.

How best to exploit repeatable from level 81-120, according to Yayoi
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Again, there are many leveling guides available, and a lot of opinions on how things can be done at this stage too. For this stage I'm going to give you a few options for some of the levels. If you have the friends and money they'll help you level really quickly, if you don't than you can still solo, or work with a group of close friends your level, and stll level, but it'll be slower.

### Level 80-90

1. There is a repeatable for gathering armor pieces in DT. You can have a higher level friend or a DT runner and a few droppers run through DT with you. Make sure you inventory is nearly empty and just fill it with these armor pieces. Once full, leave the dungeon and spam turn ins. Rince and repeat until your level 90. Don't forget to get the DT Key and quests.
2. Alternatively, you can just do all the level 7x quests. There are a few somewhat boring reps mixed in there to help you get to 90.

#### The slow way

Here are the reps you can do to help you get to 90 if you can't do DT for some reason:

1. Level 84-88 - Kidmon Rep - "Hans in Love"
2. Level 85-88 - Toy Spade Rep - "Kidmon The Menance"
3. Level 86-89 - Jewel Tree Rep - "Tree of Jewels"
4. Level 88-90 - Red Nix Rep - "A Tree With Holes"

### Level 90-105

1. You can now enter Leviathan Nest. You need to complete the quest "Lost Key to the Lighthouse" to get the key. This requires you to slay Nest Slime, which is kinda strong for its level, best to have a friend help. Once here you have the key, you can find a guildie, friend, or other LN runner and just stand around and gather exp. This is nice because you can level while you AFK like in FM, but it can be expansive because runners don't run it for free, usually.
2. Alternatively, there is a non-LN strategy that is not as easy and is a bit slower, but more than doable.

#### The slow way

1. Level 90-94 - RS Rep - Complete the following: "Burning Cave">"Burning Cave 2" to unlock "My hunches never proves wrong" - Rock Stone is also hard to kill for someone at this level, but I love killing RS so just get in-touch with me, or you can have another high level guildie or friend kill it for you while you turn in the rep.
2. Level 94-95 - Do all the non-repeatable quests you have other than the 94s
3. Level 96-97 - King Rhino Rep - "The Threats of King Rhinoce" - Pretty easy mini-boss, may even be able to solo him, but a higher level killer is faster.
4. Level 98 - do all the 9x quests to get you to 99
5. Level 99-101 - Slugs rep - "Personal Revenge"
6. Level 101-104 - Mad slugs rep - "Suspicious Big Mudmen">"Fire on Hands and Feet">"Unextinguishable Fire"
7. Level 102-106 - BB rep - "Black Bear Beatdown"

### Level 105

If you did LN above, then just do the BB rep mentioned in the slow way to get you to 106.

### Level 106-108

Okie, most of the shortcuts are done now so, no matter what, you're going to have to grind a bit. Fortunately it isn't really hard. Just remember that a lot of people are going to be doing these quests, see if you can join a party with a dedicated killer and this will go much faster. For these levels, you have the Fire Shellas rep ("Playing with Fire").

### Level 109

Complete all quests you've saved until this point. If you haven't had to do the 9x quests than this will be very quick. Otherwise, the quests in OLT are here and they are also fairly quick with any other quests you saved up. OLT is best tackled with a party though.

### Level 110-111

Nepu Nepu Neeeeep! Its time for the Nep rep. Complete "Collecting Twister Crystals" before getting the repeatable version. Believe it or not, there is nothing to collect for this rep, just killing.

### Level 112-116

Either Mean Leipoons ("Threats for Temporary Settlement 1") or Shellas rep ("Threats for Temporary Settlement 2"). It is important to note that you will have to completely The Mean Leipoons rep a few times before the Shellas rep shows up. Its weird, but true.

### Level 116-118

Wrenches rep. Unfortunately, this quest is buried under a loooong list of prequests, but here they are: "Milly's Healthy Wonder Medicine 2">"Unknown Causes.. However">"Noisy Animals 1">"Noisy Animals 2">"Special Wrenches". Once these are complete you'll get the repeatable version of "Special Wrenches". It should also be noted that you can make a ton of money by doing "The Workshop Master is making a weapon" (available at 117) while you are doing the wrenches rep, not to mention this boosts your exp too.

### Level 118-121

Junks rep. This is also buried under a loooong list of prequests, so I'll give you those too. "Smart Yeti is preparing for an Exam">"Something urgent came up to Hilda">"Sick Akisha">"North Witch's dark power">"Pagel's voice 1">"Pagel's voice 2">"Someone can help us.. Right?">"Yeti inivading Arkroute">"A strong Alliance">"To prosper Bera Village">"The Adventurers are not arriving">"The scariest monster">"A story of Valiere and Hilda 1">"A story of Vailere and Hilda 2">"A story of Valiere and Hilda 3". After *aaall* these quests, you'll finally get _"Selling Junks"_
