Leveling Your Bone-fide Adeventurer (Level 121-cap)
==================================================

After following [my guide](/~yayoi/guides/lvling/fledgling) thus far you'll notice that trying to do things solo from this point on is really hard if not impossible unless you pray really hard to the Gamingo Gods and give them plenty of offerings (by purchasing SC) 😅 So, hopefully, you've gotten yourself into a good guild *and* have managed to collect a lot of good friends. Trust me, this really helps 😜 Regardless, there are still a few levels left and loooots of repeatable quests to get through so onward to ADVENTURE.

How Best to Exploit repeatables from 121 to cap, according to Yayoi
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Okay, okay, all of the reps from here on, well from 116 on really, have a looooooooot of prequests, but they are pretty much essential for leveling now, so there isn't much you can do about it, sadly. Just hunker down, grab some friends, and grind, grind, grind.

### Levels 121-123

Do the Beaks and Shellas repeat (if you can't tell there are too many different types of Shellas in this game 😆). To get this repeat complete these quests in this order. "Embarrassed Basilone">"Basilone is avoiding to answer">"Bailone's Colleagues">"Collecting the Colleagues Belongings 1">"Collecting the Colleagues belongings 2">"Collecting the Colleagues Belongings 3">"Present for Jey">"Jey's Colleague">"Basilone's Lie">"Suspicious Basilone". That is seriously a lot 😵‍💫, but it will unlock "Continues Suspicion", a fairly good rep, and give you quite a lot of exp to boot, so it isn't all bad.

### Levels 124-125

There are actually quite a few reps here, including one that a lot of people will probably tell you about where you just go and gather a special type of wood. This rep is slow, very slow, without droppers and the rest of the reps are also pretty slow, so you can look em up in the [Fiesta Wiki]() if you'd like, but I prefer to just run around and quest here. There are lots of quests you have saved to this point and they should be more than enough to get you to 125. Also, there is the Bajou Sancturary KQ, so that can help.

### Levels 125-126

Again, the rep here is slow, so quest and do BS KQ. If you don't quite make it to 126, or you're tired of running around complete these prequests: "Ancient Scriptures (1-5)>"Oh Captain, My Captain! (1-7)">"The Arrival">"Lending A Hand">"Nighttime disturbance". After that, you'll gain two reps "Their Health Is In Danger" and "Nighttime disurbance". In the right spot, both reps can be done together.

### Levels 127-128

Mushies rep. This rep takes 6-8 hours with a full party of droppers (be nice and save the quest so you can be a dropper for others). To get this rep you only need to complete the "Mushrooms for Ursula" prequest. **Note (because no one told me this)**: You will need one basket from the item merchant in Isle of Eya for the prequest and then a *second* one for the rep. Just make sure to keep the basket in your inventory until your done.

### Levels 128-130

The second wood rep. This is much faster than mushies, but is still better with a full pty of droppers. Just look for "Serben and His Woods". The first will be a non-repeatable, turn it back into to Serben to get the repeatable version.

### Levels 130-135

From this point until cap, you will want to make sure you complete your [daily quests](/~yayoi/guides/dailies) and compete in available KQs. Daily quests reset every day at 00:00 game time. You have some rep options to help fill your time.

1. Level 130-131 - "Success is everything" or "Helping Yuna 1"
2. Level 130-132 - "Front Lines"
3. Level 132-134 - "The Predator Leader" or "Helping Yuna 2"
4. Level 134-135 - "The Final Ingredient" or "Helping Yuna 3"

*Final Note*: The 135 reps are very slow. Focus on your dailies and KQS and complete any quests you haven't done those far (aside from those your dropping for) to help move things a bit faster.

Congrats 🥳

You have now capped! What now? Uuuuuummm, I dunno, I haven't reached this point yet, but a lot of people seem to like to start over and level another character 😆
