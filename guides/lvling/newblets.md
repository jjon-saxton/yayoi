Leveling Your Newblets (level 41-80)
===================================

If you are lucky enough to be in Flaming Mine since you were a baby, you can pretty much stay there until level 50. Otherwise you should do a few repeatables and the Iyzel quests (at level 40) in order to get here. You can see the guide for babies for more information.

From this point on you will be exploiting the games various repeatable quests in order to level quickly and efficiently. In some cases you can gain up to four levels in a less than an hour, if you can catch the right quests. For now though, it is best to exploit Tower of Iyzel to get you to 41 or 42 than you should run around completing various 40-42 level quests until you reach level 43.

How best to exploit repeatables from level 43-80, in Yayoi's opinion
--------------------------------------------------------------------

There are many leveling guides available. Each guide seems to have its own way of doing things and there are a lot of arguments over what is the best way to level a character. This is simply how I like to do things. If you are in a guild academy and managed a discord invite, see if your guild has a guide and feel free to experiment.

### Level 43-44

1. Complete the quest "A bet with Marty 1" This will require you to 8 Gobling Swordman and pick up 3 Goblin Swords that they drop.
2. Once you turn in "A bet with Marty 1" you will unlock the quest "A Bet with Marty 2". This requires you to pick up 5 Goblin Swords from Goblin Swordsman and kill 10 of those mobs. This is a repeatable to quests. After a few turn ins you should be level 44 easy. Gobling Swordman are fairly easy mobs and can be solo'd by characters at this level. For clerics, however, I **highly** recommend you gather them while a friend kills em. Don't forget to heal your friend if they need it.

### Level 45-49

The repeatable above will still be available, but you will also gain access to two more repeatable quests at level 44, "Fantastic Items" and "Best Broomsticks 3". These both require items from the same mob so they can be used at the same time. "Fantastic Items" requires you to get 15 Warebear's Claws from Ware Bears while "Best Broomsticks 3", available after completing the first two "Best Broomstick" quests requires 15 Warebear Armbit Hairs. Ware Bears are a bit tougher, but can probably still be solo'd by all classes accept clerics.

### Level 49-52

At level 49, you can head to Scaffold Execution Ground through the Collapsed Prision portal. Right at this portal is a mob called Mini Lips. These will drop "Mini Lips' Lips" if you have the quest "Mannequin Lips". Pick up 10 of these and turn in. Repeat until you reach level 52.

### Level 52-55

Scaffold Execition Grounds also has a rather large pack of King Colls. These will drop "King Donkey Teeth" when you have the quest "The Unbreakable Chisel". You can pick up this quest from the quest list at level 52. This is a fairly easy and quick (especially with a killer) way to get to level 55.

### Level 55-60

Both Collapsed Prision and Scaffold Execution Grounds have prisioners, there are more of them in large groups in Collapsed prision. As part of the Level 55 quest "Escape from Concealed Prision 1" you need to kill ten of them. Once you turn this quest in, you can pick up "Escape from Concealed Prison 2". You now need to kill 20 prisioners for a turn in, but this is a repeatable and a fairly easy way to reach level 60.

### Level 60

Unfortunately, many of the above quests have expired or simply don't provide enough experience to help you get to level 61, so now you can do all the other quests you've neglected up until now. Have fun üòù!

### Level 61-64

The zombie crystal rep in Crystal Cave is the quickest way to clear these three levels. It does have a few prequests though, and will require a party. I should have a CC runner to help you though.

1. Second Tower 1
2. Second Tower 2
3. What I do?
4. Reward for Dark Crystal 3 (this is the repeatable)

### Level 64

You know all those quests you didn't do because you will killing zombies (or, more likely, having zombies killed) in CC. Yeah, do those until you get to 65. Really only need to do the 61-64 quests, save your old 5x quests for later üòâ.

### Level 65-67

Greenkies repeat is the easiest way to clear this two levels. Do get you need to clear "Dreadful Forest Elf 1". The repeatable is "Dreadful Forest Elf 2"

### Level 68

Do those old level 5x quests I mentioned before. Save the remaining level 6x quests though.

### Level 69

Do the level 6x quests now. Alternatively there is also the mud rep. It is much easier to do this rep now than it was when I first came back and many guides still omit it. Truthfully, I would only use it if I need a few more exp to get to 70, but its always there if you need it. It is called "Hair Remover" and is available at level 68, no prequests needed.

### Level 70

Your best bet, KKP KQ. Bonus, this is a fairly popular and easy KQ. Just a few of these and you should be Level 71 easy. Also, be on the look out for vendors in Uruga buying some of the rewards, they pay more than the NPCs üòâ.

### Level 71-74

Navar rep. Seriously fast with a good party or a good killer. You will need to complete "Navar Mercenaries 1", which requires you to gather 10 Navar Merc Liscences that the Nevars will occasionally drop and turn this back into Warrior Master Marty in Elderine (did I forget to mention that regular quests can no longer be turned in at the quest list as of level 60, personally, I hate that). Once you've done that you can pick up "Navar Mercenaries 2" from Marty and only count the kills.

### Level 74-76

Do any Level 6x quests you may still have as well as your level 7x quests up until this point. If this isn't quite enough to push you into level 77, than KKP is still available to help.

### Level 77-79

Okay, well, hopefully, you've managed to pick up some friends by now, or you're part of a guild academy, or your really outgoing, or I'm free. You *can* continue to do KKP all the way to 80, if, you want, but its going to be getting slow by now. My suggestion is the Lizard Knight rep. Its best to have a party with this one though. Your party should have a killer (a mage or archer that can kill groups of Lizardman Knights at once), a mob herder (someone to run around on a +1 or better mount and gather the Lizardman Knights) and at 0-3 additional party members (these will help additional items spawn and we call them droppers) all with the quest. In the right conditions you can get to 79 vary quickly. The repeatable is "Monster Collector 2", and its available once you have turned in "Master Collector 1"

### Level 79

Nix rep. This one is fairly quick. The quest is called "Slay the Fire Nix". Fire Nixes can be killed by a character at this level with some ease, but, as always, gathering them and having someone kill them with an AOE is much faster.
