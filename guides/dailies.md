A Quick Guide to Daily Quests
=============================

At level 95 you can begin doing daily quests. Daily quests reset every day at 00:00 in-game time, meaning once you turn them in they are done, but you can pick em up again the next day. From levels 90-125 you can pick up quests by purchasing a mission scroll from the mission board in Elderine. Talk to Verylo (who is standing next to the board) to actually pick up the quest. You will also turn in your quests to him.

Daily Quests (lvl 90-125)
-------------------------

+ Gargoyle Trouble (lvl 90-95)
+ What's in the Box (96-100)
+ The Fastest Monster (90-100)
+ Flapping Noises (90-100)
+ Soldiers Grave (101-105)
+ Holy Mother of Bears (105-110)
+ Lakeside Appiration (101-110)
+ King of Condors (101-110)
+ A Big Pair of Paws (111-115)
+ Witch Hunt (116-120)
+ Look at My Horse (111-115)
+ Wet Cercuits (116-120)
+ As White as Snow (111-120)
+ Spirit of the Vale (120-123)
+ Banana Hunt (124-125)
+ A Furry Gentleman (121-125)
+ Quarrel of Brothers (121-125)

It should be noted (again, because no one told me) that mission scroll cost money. You usually make enough from turning in the quest to cover the cost of it, and then some, but you need to make that payment upfront, so watch your money 😉

Daily Quest Rewards (90-125)
----------------------------

With all the repeatables and regular quests out there, why spend money to do dailies? That's a really good question, and the answer is....🥁 Tokens of the Hunter's Union! These coins can be used to purchase Hunter's Pouches (either Tier 4 for 8 tokens or Tier 5 for 12) These pouches can contain some very useful items 🤩

### Hunter's Pouch (Tier 4)

+ Hunter's Union Gambeson (this is a permenant outfit 🤩)
+ Shard of Gold Nine (Tier 4, you can use these to purchase Gold Nines (Grade 4))
+ Hunter's Concotion
+ Concentration Increase (Tier 4)
+ Strength Increase (Tier 4)
+ Dexterity (Tier 4)
+ Protection (Tier 4)
+ Rama's Potion (lvl 100)
+ Hunter's War Rant (150%)(1 Hour)
+ Radiant Fragment of Bijou
+ Powder of Harmony

### Hunter's Pouch (Tier 5)

+ Hunter's Union Gambeson
+ Shard of Gold Nine (Tier 5)
